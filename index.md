## ENS Public Good Bounties

We believe ENS is an integral part of the future infrastructure of the next phase of the web, and therefore we want to encourage the creation and adoption of new protocols that use ENS as a basis.

These bounties are provided by private individuals and some from the ENS DAO.

Bounties are for projects that are starting from scratch.
